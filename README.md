# Equility
Meet Equility, my React portfolio balancing application. Since June of 2019 I've been programming strictly in React. I'm a front end developer which means I can't use Java and I can't ask questions on Slack. This is my story. I'm going to be taking on one of personal finance's biggest challenges: Creating an efficient frontier.
